## Wetland mapping and measurement of flood inundated area using ground-reflected GNSS signals in a bistatic radar system

In this second review of the Fall colloquium series, I will review an opportunistic remote-sensing application of bistatic radar useful to measure variations in geographical characteristics.

The previous review described a paper that conducted a bistatic application experiment using a dedicated surveillance radar. I described the trade-offs associated with Passive Bistatic Radars (PBR) hitchhiking off of dedicated radar versus digital content signals. The current subject paper describes an application using the latter type of signal, specifically, signals emitted by the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS).

The area of using GNSS satellites to derive ground characteristics is known as GNSS-Reflectometry (GNSS-R). This paper differentiates by using an orbital platform (satellite) as the bistatic receiver, as opposed to the airborne, or high-altitude balloon systems of other studies. The advantage of a bistatic system in this case is that it may leverage opportunistic receiver sharing on various satellite systems.

The phenomenology exploited is the permittivity of land surfaces as a function of water content. At the L-band spectrum of GNSS, there is a convenient correlation between strength of signals scattered off the ground and the water-content of that ground, even in the presence of vegetative canopy. The vision of these applications could allow cheap, flexible, frequently-updated, mapping of wetlands globally using an existing illumination system in the GNSS.

The method uses existing remote-sensing products as templates, or replicants, for performing a cross-correlation in real-time on a satellite of opportunity. The resulting scattered power, once normalized and adjusted for variations in the radar range equation over successive measurements, can be interpreted as a measurement of water-content, averaged over a given cell of land. The discrete measurements can then be used to compile a map of geographical surfaces classified into a
small set of labels - open-water, high biomass forest, inundated vegetation, and low biomass forest.

The result of an experiment showed strong correlation to an existing data set derived from land-sat. The promise of this application is a more frequently updated, cheaper, and possibly more sensitive set of water-content maps. However, the authors note that there remains a challenge associated with differentiating water-content in water-inundated areas with heavy vegetation content acting as a shield.

Further work in the area can correct for the additional effects of surface roughness and terrain-induced elevation gradients. The former phenomenon acts as a competing signal that interferes with the permittivity-based measurement, while the latter induces a directional effect on the scattered signal which will reduce the total energy content received from that land cell.
