## Monostatic and bistatic radar measurements of birds and micro-drone

In this fourth review of the Fall colloquium series, I will review a paper which discusses an experiment aimed at characterizing phenomenology related to varying radar parameters and varying target parameters. Specifically, the paper seeks to provide experimental evidence to support development of the commercialization of micro-drone applications.

There are many promising applications of commercial drones, including improved delivery services, agricultural monitoring, search and rescue, to name only a few. There are also significant security, privacy, and safety challenges associated with these technologies. A step toward addressing the challenges involves having a distributed drone tracking system which served to monitor and control drone activities in a manner similar to airport air traffic control. The subject paper seeks to address a challenge associated with classification of small airborne targets as bird or drone.

The hypothesis follows from the expectation that the signature of the most common drone model, the quad-copter, will vary significantly from a bird in the doppler domain, even though their amplitude profiles may be similar, due to comparable radar cross sections. This makes intuitive sense given the amount of collected data showing that air vehicles with rotating aero surfaces tend to wreak havoc with the doppler content of reflected signals. The effect manifests as roughly periodic traces in doppler, offset by the velocity of the platform itself. Contrarily, the effect of a bird's wing-motion in flight is mitigated (in most frequency bands) by the non-metallic nature of a wing, and the motion being up and down, as opposed to being roughly in the same plane as the incident transmission. This variance in doppler content should provide sufficient statistical distance for radar tracking systems to classify objects of a certain class of size and speed (as would be the case with birds and quad-copters) as either bird or drone.

The paper describes cooperation with a nearby falconry center to acquire the necessary birds and handlers for the experiment. The radars used, both monostatic and bistatic, were part of an existing system call NetRAD at the University of London College, designed for experiments of this nature, where bistatic geometries, antenna polarizations, and waveform characteristics may be varied to suit the experiment. One of the contributors, Hugh Griffiths, has a long and important history of contributions to bistatic radar.

The data analysis consisted of comparing the range and doppler characteristics of the subject targets - three birds of varying size, and a quad-copter. The discussion and graphs demonstrated correlation with the expectation that each of the four would vary little in range, due to their, roughly, similar sizes. Additionally, the doppler characteristics varied significantly, adding weight to the strategy described as a means of mitigating false alarms due to birds.

Future work may further characterize the signal requirements for a desired probability of successful classification.
