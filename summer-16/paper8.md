## Ambiguity function analysis of Digital Radio Mondiale signals for HF passive bistatic radar
My previous paper reviewed topics related to bistatic radars, including a brief overview of passive bistatic radar (PBR). This review reflects my desire to dig a little deeper into this interesting subject.

The technical contribution of this paper consists of testing and validating the hypothesis that a digitally modulated signal would have superior characteristics for passive bistatic radar than would a digital signal. The paper also provides potential applications for HF PBR.

As mentioned in my previous review, PBR is appealing for several reasons. One, being passive, it is inherently stealthy. Cost also factors in as bistatic systems - which are receive-only - do not require the power, licensing, or size associated with transmitting. Further, there are reasons to believe that target cross sections (RCS) would be enhanced in some bistatic geometries. Similarly, HF radar holds appeal for surveillance and early warning systems. Being relatively low-frequency, the path loss is reduced and greater ranges are achievable. Due to atmospheric refraction HF signals provide visibility over the radio horizon, and even over the globe.

The classic method for evaluating a radar waveform is the ambiguity function, whose response represents the uncertainty in time (or range) and frequency (or Doppler) for a given waveform as well as aliasing (or ambiguities) that can occur in either domain. Said differently, the ambiguity function succinctly describes the time/frequency bandwidth as well as minimum error distribution. An ideal response is known as a thumbtack and would consist of an impulse for both Doppler and range cuts of
the response.

Previous investigations stumbled on the challenge of modulated analog signals  As such, these had poor range and Doppler resolutions that, further, varied over time, in concert with the signal payload. That is, a speech signal would generate different characteristics than a piano signal. Of course, HF transmitters were not designed with radar in mind. It was anticipated by the paper that a digital modulation scheme would generate a waveform independent of the packet payload. Such a random waveform would be nearly time-invariant.

The experiment computed the ambiguity function for a diversity of signal content types, including pauses in speech, and found that there characteristics were generally consistent. Additionally, it was found that the Doppler resolution was very small, within one hertz. This would aid in target localization and tracking.

One application of HF PBRs would be maritime, over-the-horizon, surveillance. As ships are generally slower than their airborne counterparts, longer signal integrations could be achieved without incurring the non-stationarity of randomly moving scatterers presented by aircraft. This would allow for significant noise floor reduction and improved detection.

Further work in this area might develop some of the areas mentioned in the previous paper, that of bistatic clutter and scattered cross-section, as applied to HF PBR systems.
